/**
 * A single buy (and optional matching sell) of a tracked item, forming one lot
 * of its cost basis.
 *
 * <p>{@code quantity} units were bought at {@code boughtAt} gp each. While
 * {@code soldAt} is {@code null} the lot is still held and contributes to the
 * item's cost basis and unrealized profit; once set, the lot is realized at that
 * sale price. {@code source} records how the lot entered the collection and
 * {@code sellSource} how it left it; records persisted before sources existed
 * have {@code null}, which {@link #sourceOrUnknown()} and
 * {@link #sellSourceOrUnknown()} map to {@link AcquisitionSource#UNKNOWN} — the
 * safe legacy default the schema fixtures and snapshot guard.
 *
 * <p>A sold lot whose sell source is {@link AcquisitionSource#UNKNOWN} was closed
 * at an estimated price (the current average) rather than an observed sale, and
 * is marked as such in the acquisitions table.
